    <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how Rain Alert ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and shares your information when you use our mobile application Rain Alert (the "App").</p>

        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect information about how you use the App, including alert interactions, app settings, and features you use.</li>
        <li><strong>Alert Feedback:</strong> When you provide feedback about the accuracy of weather alerts, we collect this information to improve our service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide accurate, location-based weather alerts for rain and freezing conditions</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement appropriate security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
